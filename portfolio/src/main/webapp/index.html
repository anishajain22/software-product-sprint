      <p>Hi, I am Anisha Jain. I am a final year student at NITW.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
          I am currently staying in Pune but I am originally from Chandigarh.
          I have also stayed at Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chandigarh for brief periods of time over the course of years.
          I really like to keep myslef occupied with different activites and so I keep exploring new things, be it cooking, photography or maybe just some good movies.
          I really enjoy baking and that is something I have definitely picked up on a ,ot during the quarantine.
          Reading calms me and teleports me to another world.
